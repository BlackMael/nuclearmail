# NuclearMail
NuclearMail is an experiment of writing a webmail client using React and the Flux architecture. It runs completely in the browser and uses the Gmail REST API.

Try it out at: http://ianobermiller.github.io/nuclearmail/

## Getting started

1. `npm start` will start watchify and browser-sync and open a browser window. Changing any file will build and refresh the window.

## TODO

- Routing
- Simple compose
- Compose with Markdown
- WYSIWYG composer?
- PGP encryption?
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Navigation between inbox, priority, labels, etc
- Use lodash modules
- Contribute RCSS changes upstream if applicable
- https://github.com/naman34/react-stylePrefixr (needs value support)
- https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader
